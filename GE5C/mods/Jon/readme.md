Alternative bottom belt clamp.

The objectives of this modification were to:

1. Allow the use of a M3x12SHCS instead of the buttonhead screw
Installation instructions are similar to WP's modification with the following changes:  The included "z belt clip lower" part should be used instead of the normal one.  Use a M3x12 socket head screw instead of the M3x16 BHCS.
